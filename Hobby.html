<h1> Assignment 1- Webpage 3 Hobby </h1>
<h2> Sean Bates</h2>
<p> A hobby I have was besides just playing Ice Hockey like everyone seems to do up here, I also played Ultimate Disc (frisbee). "Ultimate" as it is shortened to was created in Massachusetts and combins both Football and basketball in a way. A basic description of how it works is it is typically played on a slightly shortened Football field and has endzones much like football. The attacking team has the disc (we cannot say frisbee because the word is trademarked by Wham-O) and passes it to teammates down the field to advance towards the other teams endzone. The trick is the person once they catch the disc cannot run with it or move. They have to "plant" a pivot foot like in basketball and can rotate around that foot but cannot have it leave the ground in that spot. They also can only hold onto the disc for ten seconds while a defender counts out loud the ten seconds. The teams are each six players and each touchdown counts as one point.  </p>
<br> </br>
<p> Here is an example of people playing Ultimate Disc.  </p>

<p> Ultimate Disc was a very fun sport to play in Highschool as it had a great team atmosphere and was surprisingly easy to learn and fun to play. </p>
