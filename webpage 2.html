<h1> Assignment 1- Webpage 2 Major </h1>
<h2> Sean Bates</h2>
<p> As I stated before my Major here at UND is Commercial Aviation. I am about three quarters of the way through the program here at UND and expect to graduate hopefully next spring/summer. I was intoduced to aviation through a after school club at my highschool that got me invested in the possibilities of aviation as a career path. I have been fortunate to come to UND across the country and take some awesome classes and meet some awesome people. Some of the awesome classes I have been fortunate to take are Introduction to air traffic control, where students get to go into a radar lab and practice atc. Another awesome class was Flight Physiology where students get to see how flight impacts the human body. The highlight of that course was going inside UND's altitude chamber and experiencing hypoxia (lack of oxygen) in a safe enviorment.   </p>

<p> Here is an example of the Airplane I am flying right now, the Piper Seminole.  </p>
