<h2> Avit 325: Multi Engine Systems and Procedures </h2> <br/>

<p> Aviation 325 is the final course in the Commercial pilot Block of the UND aerospace training. The Commerical Block is made up of four flight courses working on geting an Instrument rating, multi engine endorsement, and commerical pilots license. This final course is only half the semster and goes over multi engine flying in the Piper Seminole. For this course my Instructor is Kent Lovelace, a seasoned veteran teacher who is famous here at the school. The class goes by in time very quickly as the final exam for the class is March 2nd. In total this class only meets a total of thirteen times through the semester. A fun part about the class however is that our classroom is in the "fishbowl room" on the 4th Floor of the Robin Tower (the large tower on this side of campus next to N.42nd)  </p>

<h3> The highlight of this flight course is definitly the Piper Seminole aircraft.  </h3> 
<p> The Piper Seminole Pa-44 is a four seat Multiengine aircraft that can produce 180 horsepower per engine at 2700 RPM. While being one if not the weakest twin engine aircraft in existence, it is still faster than most single engine aircraft around here. It is definitly enjoyable to finally be getting out of the Single engine archer and into something more enjoyable. The Seminole, named after the Seminole Indian tribe native to Florida, while not as big as other working class twin engine aircraft, still provides similar challenges and emergencies to practice for on for the future. The reason I talk so much about this plane in relation to the class is that the class is barely over a month long and the flying aspect of this class similar to "Lab time" counts for much of the grade in the classroom. </p>
